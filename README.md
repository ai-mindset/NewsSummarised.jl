# LenusHealthNewsSummarised.jl

Lenus Health is a UK company with a bold mission, that could greatly benefit patients: use predictive AI to accelerate diagnosis and treatment for chronic conditions. 

This is a small project that has a threefold aim: 
1. learn something new by doing
2. summarise the company's News articles
3. summarise the summaries to attempt to extract a global overview of the company's activities and aims
