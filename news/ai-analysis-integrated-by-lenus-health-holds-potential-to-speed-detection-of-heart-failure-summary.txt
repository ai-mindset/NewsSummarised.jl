 'New research presented at the ESC Conference shows AI technology interpreting heart ultrasound images is as effective as human operators, reducing diagnosis time significantly.

The OPERA study, a collaboration between Glasgow University, AstraZeneca, Lenus Health and NHS, demonstrates potential of AI to make heart failure diagnosis faster and more accessible through the SYMPHONY global study.'
