 'NHSX-funded Scottish AI project expanding to English sites in January 2022, focusing on stratifying COPD patients' risk of flare-ups, hospital admission, and mortality using machine learning models. COPD is projected to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030, and currently causes one in eight emergency hospital admissions in the UK. The priority is to reduce disease progression and prevent unscheduled care, especially during the pandemic. NHS Scotland recently started rolling out the COPD service across major urban areas for at-home management and "always-on" triage. The new year offers an opportunity to validate and adopt machine learning models for clinically actionable risk scores, elective care targets, and achieving NHS long-term plan aims.'
