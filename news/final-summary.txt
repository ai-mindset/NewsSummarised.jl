 'Lenus Health, a healthcare tech company, was shortlisted for several awards for their digital health innovations and partnerships. They focus on explainable AI and reducing healthcare inequity through data and AI use in long-term condition diagnosis and management. Their Lenus COPD Service was shown to reduce hospital admissions and bed days in Scotland. Lenus Stratify, an AI model for COPD assessment, was selected for the IDAP pilot pathway. AstraZeneca partners with Lenus Health at Slush 2022 to showcase their work. Lenus Health's Lenus Stratify identifies COPD patients at risk of hospital admission for priority treatment as part of the IDAP pilot program, aiming to shift care provision from reactive to proactive intervention.'
