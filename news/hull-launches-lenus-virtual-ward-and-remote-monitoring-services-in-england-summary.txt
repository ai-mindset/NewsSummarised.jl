 'Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (HUTH) will be the first in England to implement Lenus Health's technology for managing COPD patients at home through virtual wards and remote monitoring. This approach aims to free up hospital beds, reduce admissions, and offer personalized care. The service has shown promising results in clinical trials by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. Lenus Health co-designed the service to improve access to care for those with socioeconomic challenges. The SBRI award supports this partnership.'
