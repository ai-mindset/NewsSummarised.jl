 'The NHS is experiencing its worst winter crisis in a decade with record-breaking wait times and waiting lists exceeding 7 million people. Long-term conditions (LTCs) like heart failure, COPD, asthma, diabetes, and kidney disease account for the majority of emergency admissions and bed days. The cost of caring for LTC patients is increasing, with healthcare accounting for around 14% of the UK's GDP. Technological advancements such as intelligent models of care, proactive pathway automation, and digital biomarkers can help address this issue by providing continuous monitoring and anticipating patient deterioration. The focus should shift from specialised, episodic care to proactive, integrated, and preventive care for chronic conditions to improve outcomes and address health inequalities.'
