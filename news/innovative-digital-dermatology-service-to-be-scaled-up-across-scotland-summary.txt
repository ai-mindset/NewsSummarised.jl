 'Edinburgh-based Storm ID's Lenus Health Platform enables virtual dermatology appointments for Scottish patients with skin conditions. Patients register, submit images and answers, which are assessed remotely by dermatologists via secure messaging. Many cases can be managed without further action. The service offers convenience, saves travel time, and is valuable during COVID-19. Supported by the Modernising Patient Pathways Programme, Scottish Government and NHS National Services Scotland.'
