 'Lenus Health and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's DYNAMIC project for transforming COPD care with data and predictive AI has been shortlisted for an HSJ Digital Award under the category of Optimising Clinical Pathways Through Digital. The project, which involves developing digital tools to improve patient experience and reduce hospital admissions, was recognized for its ambitious goals, positive outcomes, value, involvement, and potential for replication. COPD affects over 1.2 million people in the UK and is the second leading cause of emergency hospital admission. The team, led by Dr Chris Carlin and Paul McGinness, has successfully evaluated the service with sustained use and reduced admissions, and scaled it up to support 500 patients with COPD. The predictive AI models developed as part of the project have been trialled and found to have a positive impact on both patients and hospital teams.'
