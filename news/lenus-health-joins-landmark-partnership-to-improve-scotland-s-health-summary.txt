 'A collaboration between NHS Scotland, academia, and industry partners, including AstraZeneca UK and Lenus Health, has signed an MOU to improve healthcare through large-scale programs focusing on long term conditions and reducing waiting times. The partnership aims to change clinical practice and expand clinical research, with a goal of enrolling patients in studies and trials for new pathways and therapies. The first project is the OPERA digital patient pathway, which reduced heart failure diagnostic tests waitlist from over 12 months to 6 weeks during a pilot.'
