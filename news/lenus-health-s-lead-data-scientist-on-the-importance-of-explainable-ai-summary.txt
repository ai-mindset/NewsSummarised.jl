 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning in clinical settings require model explainability for trust and safety. Confounding variables and biases are major challenges in developing models for clinical decision making. Asthma patients with pneumonia, for instance, were once incorrectly predicted to have greater survival probability due to treatment policy differences. Biases can also affect under-represented groups in health prediction models, resulting from ground truth diagnosis labeling and model training errors. Lenus Engineering aims to investigate why models make decisions and innovate in explainable AI, focusing on fairness, ethics, and bias reduction.'
