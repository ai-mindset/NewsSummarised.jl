 'The Lenus COPD Service, a remote monitoring program for high-risk COPD patients, has been shown to reduce hospital admissions and bed days in Scotland, according to an NHSGGC clinical trial. The service aggregates patient data into a cloud-based clinical dashboard for early intervention and prevention of unnecessary hospitalizations. AI-derived risk prediction scores are being trialed to further enhance proactive management. COPD disproportionately affects lower socioeconomic communities, making its improved management important for reducing health inequalities. ICSs are encouraged to consider virtual wards as part of their plans to address capacity issues and prevent respiratory-related admissions.'
