 'The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Napier University, NHS Lothian, and Lenus Health have collaborated to create a digital health pathway aimed at preventing reattendances to Emergency Departments for chest pain or breathlessness patients. The project utilizes DataLoch's secure healthcare data, Edinburgh Napier University's expertise in digital co-design, and Lenus Health's disease management platform. This collaboration aims to prevent one in five of the estimated 30-day reattendances in the UK, saving NHS resources and providing effective treatment earlier.'
