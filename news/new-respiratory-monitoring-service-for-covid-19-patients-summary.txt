 'Storm ID, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Altair Medical are collaborating to create a remote respiratory monitoring solution for COVID-19 patients called CARP. Using Altair's wearable sensor and algorithms alongside Storm ID's Lenus Health Platform, they will gather de-identified patient data and perform machine-learning analyses to develop risk predictive models. If effective, CARP will enable real-time identification and triaging of at-risk patients. The project is funded by the University of Glasgow under their Rapid Research in COVID-19 programme.'
