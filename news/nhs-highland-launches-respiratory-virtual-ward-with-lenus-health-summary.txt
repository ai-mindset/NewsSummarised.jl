 'NHS Highland launched a new respiratory virtual ward service using Lenus Health's technology for remote monitoring of patients with respiratory conditions at home. Up to 100 patients will benefit from this service, which enables real-time data sharing between patients and healthcare teams, encourages physical activity, and supports more responsive care. The service builds on the Dynamic Scot project in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and is part of Lenus Health's focus on transforming chronic disease care pathways with their interoperable platform.'
