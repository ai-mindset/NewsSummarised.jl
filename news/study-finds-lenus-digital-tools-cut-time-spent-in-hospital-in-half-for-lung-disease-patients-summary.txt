 'NHS researchers found that using a digital support service for patients with high-risk COPD led to a reduction in hospital days from 15 to 7 per year.'
'The study, co-led by NHS GGC consultant in emergency medicine Professor David Lowe and Lenus Health, included a patient app, clinician dashboard, and support website.'
'Engagement with the digital service was consistent across the population with COPD prevalence.'
'Patients found the service useful and easily adapted to using it regularly.'
