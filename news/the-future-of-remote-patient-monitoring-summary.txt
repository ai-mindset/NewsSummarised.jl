 'Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (HUTH) will be the first in England to use Edinburgh-based Lenus Health's technology for managing COPD patients at home, freeing up hospital beds. This approach, called a "virtual ward," uses regular interactions with care teams and remote monitoring. The service aims to reduce unplanned admissions, especially in deprived communities where COPD prevalence is high. HUTH was inspired by successful trials in Scotland, and Lenus received funding for the partnership.'
