 'The NHS is experiencing its worst winter in a decade with record-breaking A&E waits, ambulance delays, and waiting lists over 7 million people. Long-term conditions (LTCs) affect around 15 million people in England, with heart failure, COPD, asthma, diabetes, and kidney disease being the most common. Delivering value in current healthcare systems is a challenge, leading to increased spending. Technology, data structuring, and AI can transform expensive services into affordable ones, and proactive pathways are essential for managing multimorbid patients. The UK's population aged 65 and above is projected to grow significantly, necessitating intelligent models of care and automation. Shifting resources towards preventive care pathways for chronic conditions can address capacity issues and health inequalities.'
