 'Pharmacovigilance is the science of drug safety, involving detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse events. It ensures benefits of drugs outweigh risks throughout their lifecycle. An adverse event is a negative reaction to a drug, with serious cases causing hospitalization or disability. Pharmacovigilance became crucial after the thalidomide disaster in the 1960s. Digital technologies and patient-generated health data offer opportunities for more efficient pharmacovigilance programs.'
