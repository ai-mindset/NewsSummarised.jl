 'The NHS is experiencing its worst winter crisis in the last decade with record-breaking A&E waits, ambulance delays, and waiting lists over 7 million people. Long-term conditions (LTCs) such as heart failure, COPD, asthma, diabetes, and kidney disease are major issues, accounting for over 70% of inpatient bed days. The cost of caring for LTC patients is increasing, and technology and AI can help by transforming expensive services into affordable ones and providing intelligent, proactive care. A shift from specialised, episodic care to integrated, preventative care for chronic conditions is necessary to address capacity issues and health inequalities.'
