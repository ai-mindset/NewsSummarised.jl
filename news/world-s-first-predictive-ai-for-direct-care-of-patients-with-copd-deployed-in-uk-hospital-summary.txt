 'A 12-month feasibility study called DYNAMIC-AI was launched to explore how AI can be used in live point-of-care workflows for COPD patients in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The project uses machine learning models to identify high-risk COPD patients, allowing proactive interventions to improve outcomes and reduce emergency hospital admissions. It is the first operationalised predictive AI application in routine direct care of chronic conditions, with a goal of addressing equality issues and improving access to healthcare for socio-economically disadvantaged areas.'
